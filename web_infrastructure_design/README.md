## :eye: About

<br>

<div align="center">

**`Web infrastructure design`** project focuses on understanding and designing various components of **web systems**.
<br>
The files cover different aspects of web infrastructure, including server configurations, load balancing, and database management.
<br>
<br>
This project has been created by **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/about-holberton)** to enable every student to understand **how web systems are structured and function in real-world scenarios**.

</div>

<br>
<br>

### Web infrastructure:

<br>

[![Web infrastructure](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlQNEW76KdYg%26t%3D3s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQNEW76KdYg&t=3s)

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tasks

<br>

**`0. Simple web stack`**

**`1. Distributed web infrastructure`**

**`2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure`**

**`3. Scale up`**

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :memo: Learning Objectives

<br>

**_You are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:_**

<br>

```diff

General

+ You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects

+ You must be able to explain what each component is doing

+ You must be able to explain system redundancy

+ Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

```

<br>
<br>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## :computer: Requirements

<br>

```diff

General

+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

+ For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram


This project will be manually reviewed:

+ As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green

+ Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).

+ For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file

+ After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box

+ You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session


Focus on what you are being asked:

+ Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project

+ Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements

+ Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you

- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked

```
